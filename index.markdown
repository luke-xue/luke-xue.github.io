Hey, I'm Luke Xue!

I'm a Senior at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) studying Computer Science and graduating this Fall. I'm currently building AI tools for healthcare system pharmacies to optimize their documentation and revenue integrity. Previously, I've worked at a variety of companies ranging from early-stage to late-stage. At [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), I worked with a brand new product on the international exchange. At [Noldor](https://www.noldor.com/), I built microservices for data pipelines. At [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/), I made an internal ChatGPT-style tool. At [Premise Data](https://premise.com/), I refactored an open-source project for quick Google Cloud Platform deployments.

I also source early-stage startups and founders as a [Pear](https://pear.vc/) Venture Fellow and was President of the [Columbia Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs](https://www.coreatcu.com/). Previously, I was a lead for [Almaworks](https://www.alma.works/), a student-run startup accelerator.

I'm originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico but spend most of my time in New York City. My favorite movie is [Minari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ0gFidlro8), I play saxophone and piano, and I watch an absurd amount of tennis. When I'm not on campus, you can find me running down Riverside Park or wandering through a museum.
