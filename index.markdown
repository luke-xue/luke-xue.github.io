Hello world, I'm Luke!

I'm a Junior at Columbia University studying Computer Science. I've worked as a Software Engineering Intern at a variety of companies ranging from early to late stage. At [Noldor](https://www.noldor.com/), I built microservices for data pipelines. At [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/), I made an internal ChatGPT-style tool. At [Premise Data](https://premise.com/), I refactored an open-source project for quick Google Cloud Platform deployments.
